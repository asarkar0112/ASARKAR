This is my first day in GitHub, today's date is 18th February, 2020, time 5:34pm and I am sitting in IC, MIT right now just after I finished answering my last exam of the sessionals that is Publishing Science and I have no clue whatsoever of what I'm doing rn but it's gonna be fun I guess. I got this feeling. So fingers crossed.
